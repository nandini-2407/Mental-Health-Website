<p id="multiple-columns"> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a toll on the mental health of millions of people around the world.
    <br> For many people, it is challenging to adapt to the new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, 
     and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues. 
     <br> Added to this comes managing the fear of contracting the virus and worry about people close to us who are particularly vulnerable. 
     Recognizing that this situation can be particularly difficult for people with mental health conditions, we would like to encourage you to try doing these 
     things to help mantain a good mental health during a pandemic and quaratine.

    <p id="routine" ><img src="images/routine.jpg" style="width:40%; height:100%; float:right; margin-left: 1%" > 
     We know how important routine is, especially for kids, under normal conditions. And when schools are closed and many people are 
     working from home or told to stay at home, it might feel like all bets are off. But it’s actually much better for everyone’s mental health 
     to try to keep a routine going, as much as possible.
    <br> This means eating meals at regular times, sleeping, waking and exercising at set times, and maintaining social (socially distant) contact. 
    Unstructured time can create boredom, spikes in anxiety or depression, which can lead to unhealthy patterns of coping.
    Another reason is that keeping a routine reduces “decision fatigue,” the overwhelm and exhaustion that can come from too many options.
     So in the morning, rather than wondering whether to start work or help the kids with their online learning, it’s better to know what you’re going 
     to do—make a schedule that everyone can get on board with, and try to stick with it (as much as is possible—don’t beat yourself up if it doesn’t 
     always work, and it’s sure not to work some days). This will free up some mental bandwidth during this time of uncertainty, which is already 
     straining everyone’s cognitive capacities.

<div class="organize">
  <button id="button2" >Declutter your home</button>
  <p id="declutter" ><img src="images/organize.jpg" style="width:40%; height:100%; float:right; margin-left: 1%" >
    Working on your home if you have time can be a good way to feel productive and in control (see caveat down below though). 
    “Take the opportunity of the extra time by decluttering, cleaning or organizing your home,” says Serani, referencing the book Trauma-Informed Care. 
    “Studies say the predictability of cleaning not only offers a sense of control in the face of uncertainty, but also offers your mind body and 
    soul a respite from traumatic stress.”
    The caveat is that you don’t want to become obsessive about cleaning, since there’s only so much you can do. 
    But using the extra time, if you have it, to reorganize and toss or donate items you no longer use is a very good idea.
    <br> <br> 
    After hours of cleaning we all deserve some rest, don't we?

<div class="relax">
  <button  id="button3" >Meditate, or just breathe</button>
  <p id="meditate" > <img src="images/meditate.jpg" style="width:40%; height:100%; float:right; margin-left: 1%" >  
    Meditation has lots of research behind it, as most people by now know—it’s been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, 
    and even increase the volume of certain areas of the brain. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinnat UMass, 
    has been shown, through numerous studies, to be effective—and while it generally involves an eight-week course, a number of organizations offer
     this online. 
     But if meditation isn’t for you, just breathing slowly might be. Controlled breathing has been used for millennia to calm 
     the mind—and a study a few years ago showed the mechanism that might explain it. The researchers found that a tiny subset of 
     neurons in the area of the brain known to control various types of breathing also seemed to house a group of neurons that controlled 
     the animals’ level of arousal. Knocking this area out made mice uncharacteristically calm—and the team believe that slow breathing might
      also tap into this area of the brain and have the same effect.

<div class="relax">
<button id="button4" >Get outside—in nature—if you can</button>
<p id="nature" ><img src="images/walk.jpg" style="width:40%; height:100%; float:right; margin-left: 1%" >
  This is much easier in the country or suburbs, but if you’re in the city and it’s feasible, shimmy past your building neighbors 
  and go for a walk in the park. Remember to stay six feet away from other people—as city dwellers know, this can take some maneuvering, 
  but it’s possible.
  And there are some very good reasons to do so. Lots of recent research finds that spending time in nature is a boon to both mental 
  and physical health. For instance, multiple studies have found that time in green and blue space is associated with reduced anxiety and depression,
   and the connection may well be a causal one.
  </p>
</div> 


<div class="activities">
  <button  id="button5">Be of service, from a distance</button>
  <p id="service" ><img src="images/service.jpg" style="width:40%; height:100%; float:right; margin-left: 1%" >
    Being of service is one of the best things we can do for society—and on a more selfish note, for ourselves. 
    Studies have repeatedly found that serving others, even via small acts of kindness, has strong and immediate mental health benefits. 
    And feeling a sense of purpose has also been shown to help people recover from negative events and build resilience. 
    For people who are lucky enough to be healthy right now and not caring for a loved one who’s sick, finding ways to help others 
    in this kind of crisis is probably very good for your own well-being.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="activities">
<button id="button6" >Start an at-home exercise routine</button>
<p id="exercise" ><img src="images/exercise.jpg" style="width:40%; height:100%; float:right; margin-left: 1%" >
  Working out at home in these times is obviously a good way to stay healthy and kill indoor time. There are lots of options, 
  from the 21st century ones (Peloton and MIRROR) to the old-fashioned ones (workout videos and the dusty hand weights in your closet). 
  Many online workout sources are offering free access or longer free trial periods during this time, which might be worth looking into. 
  But again, anything that gets your heart pumping or builds muscle is excellent for both physical and mental health.
